# Neural-Network-Projects
This repo contains projects related to autoencoders and multilyaer perceptron
1.  One is a Multi Layer Perceptron built using thomson reuters dataset. 99% accuracy was achieved

2. Other project (AUENUSDEN.IPYNB) is an auto encoder model used for reducing noise from an image. Testing loss was reduced to 0.304.

3. Third One(Ganker.ipynb) is generating artifical images using dcgan's with keras as backend. The GAN consists of two adversarial players: a discriminator and a generator. Used  Minimax strategy game theory for training discriminator and generator.
